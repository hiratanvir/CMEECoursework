# Write a short python script to populate a dictionary called taxa_dic 
# derived from  taxa so that it maps order names to sets of taxa. 
# E.g. 'Chiroptera' : set(['Myotis lucifugus']) etc. 

# ANNOTATE WHAT EVERY BLOCK OR IF NECESSARY, LINE IS DOING! 

# ALSO, PLEASE INCLUDE A DOCSTRING AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS FILE THAT 
# SAYS WHAT THE SCRIPT DOES AND WHO THE AUTHOR IS

# Write your script here:

taxa_dic = {} #making an empty dictionary
for x in taxa:
   if x[1] not in taxa_dic: #if x(1) not in the taxa_dic, put it in by...
      taxa_dic[x[1]] = set () #...creating a new set for that the taxa_dic dictionary and for each x[1]..
   taxa_dic[x[1]].add(x[0]) #... function will add x[0] to x[1]
print taxa_dic
