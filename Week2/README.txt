Week 2 Directory contents

Code:
1.  basic_csv.py 
# Importing the csv module which makes it easy to manipulate CSV files

2.  boilerplate.py 
# Forming a python function that can be run as a script and main functions can also be called fro the command line. 

3.  basic_io.py 
# Imports a txt file, reads it, uses implicit loop to skip blank lines, and writes file that has blank lines removed. 
 
4.  scope.py 
# Creating a variable inside and outside a function, as well as a global variable which are visible inside and outside of functions.

5.  control_flow.py 
# Creating control flow statement that execute the program’s code in a certain order, using conditional statements, loops and function calls to regulate this.

6.  cfexercises.py
# Control flow exercises and explanation of each function.

7.  sysargv.py
# Creating a script that creates a list of command-line arguments using sys.argv.

8.  loops.py
# Creating a script that uses loops ‘for’ and ‘while’ as control statments.

9.  oaks.py
# Using loops and list comprehension to find a specific group of taxa from a list of species.

10. dictionary.py
# Making a dictionary derived from taxa that maps order names to sets of taxa.

11. lc1.py
# Using list comprehension and conventional loops, creating 3 separate lists from a list of tuples in a tuple.

12. lc2.py
# Using list comprehension and loops, creating two sets of data which shows months and rainfall, when rainfall was greater than 100 mm and less than 50 mm.

13. tuple.py
# Creating a script which prints out tuples within a tuple of separate lines.

14. debug.py
# Creating a script and importing pdb to help identify bugs in the script.

15. test_oaks.py
# Identifying bugs and debugging the script.

16. test_control_flow.py
# Using unit testing with doctest verifies expected outcome of your function, and helps you identify if there are errors in the code if outcome is unexpected. 

17. using_name.py 
# Making a file that can be used as a script and also have its modules imported

18. align_seqs.py
# Script reads external csv file containing two DNA sequences, finds the best match between the pairs, and prints into a txt file.

Data:
1.  align.csv
2.  JustOaksData.csv
3.  testcsv.csv
4.  TestOaksData.csv
