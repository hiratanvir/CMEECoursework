Week 7 - Advanced Python
Directory Contents:

Code:
1.  LV1.py #Using python imports scipy to perform mathematical functions and pylab to plot graph 

2.  profileme.py #using the %run -p (filename) command to profile function execution times in script

3.  timeitme.py #Using timeit to find the most efficient method, i.e. loops, to run script

4.  LV2.py #Modification of LV1.py by taking arguments for parameters from the command line
 
5.  run_LV.sh #Profiling the two scripts to determine time it takes to run each loop

6.  DrawFW.py #Using networkx package to plot networks graph using randomly number generation

7.  Nets.R #Using igraph in R to plot networks graph visualising QMEE CDT collaboration network, coloring the nodes by node type, plotting weighted edges, and adding a legend

8.  Nets.py #Replicating Nets.R graph in python using networkx

9.  regexs.py #Using regex functions from python module re- to search string for match to given pattern

10.  blackbirds.py #Using regex on csv file, using re.findall function to extract specific characters

11. Test.R #Creating a simple R-script to test python's subprocess module

12. TestR.py #Using subprocess.Popen to open execute R-script from within python/ipython

13. using_os.py #Using subprocess and os to get a list of files and directories from home directory

14. fmr.R #R-script which plots a logarithmic graph and writes list of species to a csv file

15. run_fmr_R.py #using subprocess.Popen to open and run fmr.R, printing R console output to python console

16. re4.py #Parsing email addresses using regex

17. MyFirstJupyterNb.ipynb #My first jupyter notebook


Data: 
1. blackbirds.txt #Data used for blackbirds.py

2. NagyEtAl1999.csv #Data used for fmr.R

3. QMEE_Net_Mat_edges.csv #Edges data used for Nets.py and Nets.R

4. QMEE_Net_Mat_nodes.csv #Nodes data used for Nets.py and Nets.R

Results:
To be produced when you run the scripts.
