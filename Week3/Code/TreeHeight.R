# This function calculates heights of trees from the angle of
# elevation and the distance from the base using the trigonometric
# formula height = distance * tan(radians)
#
# ARGUMENTS:
# degrees The angle of elevation
# distance The distance from base
#
# OUTPUT:
# The height of the tree, same units as "distance"
TreeHeight <- function(degrees, distance){
	radians <- degrees * pi / 180
	height <- distance * tan(radians)
	print(paste("Tree height is:", height))
	return (height)
}
