Code:
1. TreeHeight.R #Calculates tree heights using trigonometric formula
2. Vectorize1.R #Compares speed of script when function uses vectorization that avoids looping

3. apply1.R #Vectorizes a row or column of a matrix by using apply on Râ€™s inbuilt functions
4. apply2.R #Using apply to define your own functions

5. break.R #Breaking out of a loop when condition is met
6. next.R #Skips iterations if condition for i is met

7. Vectorize2.R #Vectorizing script to make it faster by avoiding loops and using apply
8. PP_Lattice.R #Draws 3 lattice graphs and calculates mean and median by feeding type 

9.DataWrang.R #transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format
10.basic_io.R #A simple R script to illustrate R input-output

11.boilerplate.R #Making a function that uses a re-usable code for every scenario using arguments
12.get_TreeHeight.R #Making a more general script that takes csv filename from command line

13.run_get_TreeHeight.sh #Unix shell script that runs an R script
14.Control.R #Script shows the use of control statements in R using loops

15.Sample.R #Script shows the use of sample function which samples from a dataset with replacement
16.try.R #Script uses try function to keep running the code after an error is caught

17.browse.R #Browser() opens an interactive session at an arbitrary location in the code
18.TAutoCorr.R #Creates two vectors and computes correlation between the two sets of non-independent data

19.PP_Regress.R #Script draws and saves a facet_grid graph and calculates regression results 
20.TAutoCorr.tex #Script writes the result for TAutoCorr.R script into a latex script

21.TAutoCorrGraph.pdf #Graph showing correlation between sequential time series
22.TAutoCorr.pdf #Result for TAutoCorr.R script into a latex document
