@article{Rampelotto2013,
abstract = {Over the last decades, the study of extremophiles has providing ground breaking discoveries that challenge the paradigms of modern biology and make us rethink intriguing questions such as "what is life?", "what are the limits of life?", and "what are the fundamental features of life?". These findings and possibilities have made the study of life in extreme environments one of the most exciting areas of research in recent decades. However, despite the latest advances we are just in the beginning of exploring and characterizing the world of extremophiles. This special issue discusses several aspects of these fascinating organisms, exploring their habitats, biodiversity, ecology, evolution, genetics, biochemistry, and biotechnological applications in a collection of exciting reviews and original articles written by leading experts and research groups in the field.

@article{Garcia2016,
abstract = {Prokaryotic planktonic organisms are small in size but largely relevant in marine biogeochemical cycles. Due to their reduced size range (0.2 to 1 $\mu$m in diameter), the effects of cell size on their metabolism have been hardly considered and are usually not examined in field studies. Here, we show the results of size-fractionated experiments of marine microbial respiration rate along a latitudinal transect in the Atlantic Ocean. The scaling exponents obtained from the power relationship between respiration rate and size were significantly higher than one. This superlinearity was ubiquitous across the latitudinal transect but its value was not universal revealing a strong albeit heterogeneous effect of cell size on microbial metabolism. Our results suggest that the latitudinal differences observed are the combined result of changes in cell size and composition between functional groups within prokaryotes. Communities where the largest size fraction was dominated by prokaryotic cyanobacteria, especially Prochlorococcus, have lower allometric exponents. We hypothesize that these larger, more complex prokaryotes fall close to the evolutionary transition between prokaryotes and protists, in a range where surface area starts to constrain metabolism and, hence, are expected to follow a scaling closer to linearity.},

@article{DeLong2010,
abstract = {The diversification of life involved enormous increases in size and complexity. The evolutionary transitions from prokaryotes to unicellular eukaryotes to metazoans were accompanied by major innovations in metabolic design. Here we show that the scalings of metabolic rate, population growth rate, and production efficiency with body size have changed across the evolutionary transitions. Metabolic rate scales with body mass superlinearly in prokaryotes, linearly in protists, and sublinearly in metazoans, so Kleiber's 3/4 power scaling law does not apply universally across organisms. The scaling of maximum population growth rate shifts from positive in prokaryotes to negative in protists and metazoans, and the efficiency of production declines across these groups. Major changes in metabolic processes during the early evolution of life overcame existing constraints, exploited new opportunities, and imposed new constraints.},

@article{Glazier,
abstract = {1. Metabolic rate is conventionally assumed to scale with body mass to the 3 ⁄ 4-power, indepen-dently of the metabolic level of the organisms being considered. However, recent analyses in a variety of animals and plants indicate that the power (log–log slope) of this relationship varies significantly with metabolic level, ranging from c. 2 ⁄ 3 to 1. 2. Here I show that the scaling slopes of rates of respiration and growth are related to the metabolic level of a variety of unicellular organisms, as similarly occurs for respiration rates in multicellular organisms. 3. The recently proposed 'metabolic-level boundaries hypothesis' provides insight into these effects of metabolic level. As predicted, the scaling slopes for resting (endogenous) respiration rate in prokaryotes, algae and protozoans are negatively related to metabolic level; and in proto-zoans, the scaling slope increases with starvation. Also as predicted, the scaling slopes of growth rate in algae and protozoans are negatively related to growth level. Unexpectedly, opposite effects of starvation on the metabolic scaling slopes of unicellular prokaryotes (compared to that of eukaryotes) may be a spurious result of respiration measurements that did not adequately consider the effects of rapid cell multiplication in prokaryotes with extremely short generation times. 4. Analyses of both unicellular and multicellular organisms show that there is no universal meta-bolic scaling relationship, and that variation in metabolic scaling relationships is systematically and possibly universally related to metabolic level.},

@article{Rasconi2017,
abstract = {Global climate change scenarios predict lake water temperatures to increase up to 4°C and extreme weather events, including heat waves and large temperature fluctuations, to occur more frequently. Such changes may result in a reorganization of the plankton community structure, causing shifts in diversity and structure toward a community dominated by fewer species that are more adapted to endure warmer and irregular temperature conditions. We designed a long-term (8 months) mesocosm experiment to explore how ambient water temperature (C: control), induced increased tempera-ture (T: +4°C), and temperature fluctuations (F: ±4°C relative to T) change phytoplank-ton phenology, taxonomical diversity, and community structure, and how such changes affected zooplankton abundance and composition. Synthesis. Our results show that T and F relative to C significantly decreased phytoplankton diversity. Moreover, there was a clear effect of the temperature treatments (T and F) on phytoplankton size structure that resulted in a significantly lower growth of large species (i.e., large Chlorophyta) compared to C. Decreased diversity and evenness in the T and F treat-ments pushed the community toward the dominance of only a few phytoplankton taxa (mainly Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta) that are better adapted to endure warmer and more irregular temperature conditions. The observed shift toward Cyanobacteria dominance may affect trophic energy transfer along the aquatic food web.},
